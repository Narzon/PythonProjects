      # Insert an element in the list.  You will need this to build your
      # circular list from the data strings in the input file.  Hint:  figure
      # out which of the "add" methods we've discussed in class to use is
      # useful here and use it as a template for this method.

      # Delete the node pointed to by "current" from the circular list.

      # would only be called if there are at least 2 nodes in the list.
      # Return a pointer to the node immediately following the deleted
      # one.  Hint:  be sure to correctly handle the case where you delete
      # the first node in the circular list.

   def __str__ (self):
      # Return a string representation of the circular list.  It should
      # include line breaks after every ten elements in the list.
